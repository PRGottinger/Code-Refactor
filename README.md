# Horiseon Services Homepage Refactor

##Description

This repository includes a code refactor for the Horiseon Services landing page.

This code refactor was conducted to improve the website's accesiblity, preformance and optimization for search engines through:

1.  The inclusion of semantic html elements.
2.  Including alt atributes to the <img> elements in the html markup.
3.  Improving the order of the heading atributes in the html.
4.  Including a concise and descriptive title.
5.  Fixingall the links in the header, so they work correctly.
6.  Improving the structure of styling and positioning the CSS stylesheet by consolidating classes and organizing the stylesheet to follow semantic structure. This also greatly shortened the lines of code on the CSS stylesheet.
